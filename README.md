# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Task 1: 
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The dataset provides information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as age, gender, class, and survival status. 

## Dataset Information
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file
- **Files:**
  - `tested.csv`

## Files in this Repository
- `Titanic_Survival_Prediction_CodSoft.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the analysis.
- `tested.csv`: Train and Test Dataset.

## Analysis Highlights
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Engineered new features for better model performance.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the distribution of key variables (age, gender, class).
   - Investigated survival rates across different categories.

3. **Statistical Insights:**
   - Calculated summary statistics for key variables.
   - Conducted hypothesis tests if applicable.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Created visualizations to convey key insights.
   - Used matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

4. **Data Modelling:**
   - Used the Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, xgboost Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boost Classifier, and KNN classifier.
   - All the algorithm gave 100% accuracy.

## Running the Analysis
1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction_CodSoft.ipynb`

## Contributions and Issues
Feel free to contribute to the analysis or report any issues. Pull requests are welcome!
